### ü§ñ GitHub Action Related

- Trick GHA into [revealing a secret](https://gist.github.com/clarkritchie/def05211e6dd0ec6a8e1edd48f0f822b)
- Example of how you might [lint in a GHA](https://gist.github.com/clarkritchie/2f935597b9398a34380e8c9a90005b6f) -- this example is for Terraform, but could be used to lint Python code with Ruff, etc.
- Full example of the [context object](https://gist.github.com/clarkritchie/b84937c0c83bcf1de9f25ca63bcaf77a)
- If you must do a [nested ternary](https://gist.github.com/clarkritchie/d3c35a9feeec5ed62ddbb38172ee62c2)

### :lock: 1Password Related

- Sort a [1Password Note](https://gist.github.com/clarkritchie/1e223f3cd3657cd00722be52f4249c1a)
- I made this Python script to [read Secure Notes from 1Password and push to GitHub Secrets](https://github.com/clarkritchie/1pw-github-secrets) -- this is very bespoke but is how we used 1Password Notes as the "source of truth" for env vars which were stored as GitHub secrets (environment, repository or organization) -- code was originally forked from someone else's project then heavily modified for my needs
- Do the above [but in a GHA](https://gist.github.com/clarkritchie/843c54c66af0833d05a88ab6fd84a544) -- this is the way

### Terraform Related

I need to scrub these projects for senstive data before I can link them.

- `app-api-uploads `-- File uploads
- `app-frontends` -- Hosting for React apps on S3 with CloudFront, etc.
- `aws-alarm-infrastructure` -- CloudWatch alarms and monitoring
- `aws-docker-swarm` -- VPC, subnets, EC2s, user data, etc.
- `aws-elasticache-redis` -- Redis
- `aws-guardduty` -- Sets up Guard Duty in 4 regions
- `aws-iam-accounts` -- Used to manage IAM jusers
- `aws-postgres-rds` -- RDS Serverless v2
- `backend-remote-state`-- Terraform for the Terraform
- `github-manager` -- How I managed GitHub... this one needs a lot of refactoring
